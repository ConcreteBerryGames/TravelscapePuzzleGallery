# Travelscape Puzzle Gallery

## Purpose
This is my first game in Unity, built as an exercise and research project while working on a larger game for the [Safe In Our World Mental Health Game Dev Champions 2024](https://itch.io/jam/mental-health-game-dev-champions-2024). This is a small, relaxing desktop slide puzzle game.

As this is my first step into game development, please be aware:
- The code structure is rough.
- The code itself is not pretty.
- There are probably many things wrong I haven't considered yet.

If you have any advice that might help me on my game dev journey, feel free to comment on the code.

## Usage
You can download the repository, open the project in Unity (built on version 2022.3.23f), build for your OS, and play. If you want, you can change the textures to your own photos and play a personalized version of the game. You can also download the build from [https://concreteberry.itch.io/travelscape-puzzle-gallery](https://concreteberry.itch.io/travelscape-puzzle-gallery).
